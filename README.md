### Software & Cloud Engineer & Language Lover

👨🏻‍💻 I love writing code. I've been coding for nearly 10 years and and I have the same drive for it now that I did when I started out learning.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything Python or Go or AWS or Kubernetes. I'm trying to spend more time contributing to open source because I love the community and what is stands for.

📫 How to reach me: kylehodgetts@gmail.com

⚡ Fun fact: I actually wear trousers when working from home. Apparently I'm in the minority
