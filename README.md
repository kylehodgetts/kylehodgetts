### Software & Cloud Engineer & Language Lover

I love writing code. I've been coding for nearly 10 years and and I have the same drive for it now that I did when I started out learning.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working for Opinov8 as a Cloud Engineer building and supporting large scale cloud infrastructures for clients and writing awesome internal tools in Python and Terraform modules.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Ukrainian ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ but I also speak Polish ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything Python or Go or AWS or Kubernetes. I'm trying to spend more time contributing to open source because I love the community and what is stands for.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: kyle.hodgetts@icloud.com

âš¡ Fun fact: I actually wear trousers when working from home. Apparently I'm in the minority
